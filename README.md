# c-tpb-motivation-decision-graph
Motivation decision-graph (MDG). A heuristic for human-aware planning. The MDG is modelled in the structure of a transiton system using Action Reasoning-based Answer Set Programming. States correspond to mental states of a human agent. Transitions correspond to suitable motivational focus for changing mental state given an estimated mental state. The system is modelled following a psychological theory, the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and shaped following a knowledge elicitation study with experts, e.g., psychologists.
